# Volvo Online Store

This is a frontend example for an online store, with a Volvo car dealership theme.

It is built with **React** and uses **react-router-dom** for routing between different pages.

You are able to browse the shop, click on items to open up a more detailed page, add these items to the cart, and change the quantity desired.

Additional feature to add in the future would be a 'Delete' button for the items in the cart, to completely remove them, not just reduce their number to 0.
